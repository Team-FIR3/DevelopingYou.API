## Entity Relationship Diagram
[ERD](/assets/ERD.jpg)

Developing You contains two main tables; a table containing the user's goals, and a table that involves each instance of the user working towards their goal. 
Each goal can contain starting value, a target value, a unit of measurement for their goal, and a list of categories of goals for them to work towards. 
Each goal can contain many instances, which include a date, a start time, an end time, and a spot for the user to write about it as a comment.  

We, the developers at Developing You are also working towards a strategy table that would be connected to the goals table. 
This would, in theory, allow users to have helpful links, ideas or other useful strategies to consume so they can progress towards their goal seemlessly.
